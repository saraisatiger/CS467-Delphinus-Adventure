The undersides of the transplanted palms glow brilliant magenta from the pool’s excessive underwater LED’s. The water is perfect temperature, and you’re so relaxed that you could whiz, but you mostly don’t. \"Sweet moves,\" says Acid Burn, swimming over next to you and looking extra fine. \"Whoa! Check that out.\" The windows of a nearby office building suddenly light up in a numerical pattern flashing figures and names in golden lights. Acid Burn gestures at to the diving board. \"Why don’t you trick off that diving board and go for a better score? \".",
